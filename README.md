This project is for my create performence task for CSP for the 22-23 school year.
It is a country guesser game.
The user is shown an outline of acountry and has to guess what country is beening presented to them.
For every right answer the score of the user is increased by one, the score of the user starts at zero.
At the end of the game the user is shown their score and presented with the names of all the countrys in the order that they appeared in.
The user is then prompted to enter a name to save their score under and shown the highest score.
